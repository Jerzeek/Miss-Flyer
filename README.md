Miss Flyer the best use of a misprint!
It can turn an ordenairy paper into an extra ordaniary paper plane with only one swipe! :open_mouth:


Entirely made from one single sheet of lasercutted plywood.

KRO-NCRV, Klaas vindt uit (Dutch TV) seemed to like it, so they wanted to show it to everyone :smiley: here is a to the video:

6. Cutout wood between holes so wire can sit flush and slider can still slide:

7. Glue or bolt clip down and add a piece of rubber (in my case bike tire) to the clip for better grip:

Changelog:
 - Version 1: Genesis
 - Version 2: Changed xx from 5mm to 3mm, changed distance between step 1 and 2 from xx mm to xx mm
 - Version 3: Zohar & me made the second version but this raised some issues. changed xx from 3mm to 5mm again cause the paper kept ripping. changed the cutouts to 4.95mm so it's more of a friction fit.

Future development:
 - [x] Write building Instructions
 - [x] Better performance
 - [x] Engraving
 - [ ] No need for glue (?)
 - [ ] More paper plane designs
 - [x] Have a paper plane war at the office!
